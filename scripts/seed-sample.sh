  My inbox     approvals waiting, under "Available to Claim"

  Sign in as any of these — all with the password ${SAMPLE_PASS}:

    manager    sees the approvals under GBP 1,000
    director   sees the ones above it
    reviewer   sees the supplier compliance review, once the incident
               below is resolved and the process reaches that step

  ${ADMIN_USER} is in all three groups, so it sees everything.

  The amount decides who approves: under 100 needs nobody, under 1000 a
  manager, anything more a director. docs/data-flow.md follows one through.

  One supplier check is running, and it fails on purpose: its first step calls
  https://api.example.com, which does not exist. It retries with backoff first,
  so give it a couple of minutes — the incident appears once the retries are
  spent, not straight away. Then: Instances → the failed one → "Show what
  failed", which explains the cause and offers a retry. That is the operator's
  half of the product, and it needs something broken to show.
