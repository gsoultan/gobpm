// Package userimport reads a CSV of workflow participants.
//
// Importing a directory is the normal way a team arrives: somebody exports a
// list from an HR system and expects to paste it in, not to type five hundred
// names into a form. What makes it worth its own package is that almost none of
// the work is reading commas — it is deciding what to do with the rows that are
// wrong, and that decision has to be made once, in a place with tests, rather
// than in the middle of a request handler.
//
// The rule everywhere below: a bad row is reported with its line number and the
// rest of the file still imports. An all-or-nothing import of a five-hundred-row
// file fails on row four hundred and leaves whoever ran it to work out which
// rows had landed — the answer being none, which they then have to trust.
