// These were compile-time constants: five workers, a two-second tick, and one
// claim of at most five jobs per tick. That is a ceiling of about 2.5 jobs a
// second per replica no matter what the machine or the database can do, and no
// way to raise it short of a rebuild. It also meant a burst of a thousand timers
// drained at a fixed rate while the pool sat mostly idle between ticks.
//
// The interval is also a latency floor: a service task enqueued just after a
// tick waits the better part of it before anything looks. Two seconds is a long
// time to a process that is otherwise instant.
