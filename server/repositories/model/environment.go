// Environment is one runtime a project deploys into — dev, staging, production
// — and the database that runtime owns.
//
// This row lives in the main database. What the environment's own database
// holds is the runtime: deployed models, instances, tasks, jobs. Nothing is
// shared between two of them, which is stronger than scoping rows by a column
// because there is no query that could reach across even if one were written
// wrong.

	Name string
	// Port is where this environment is served. Unique across the installation
	// rather than per project: two listeners cannot share one, and finding that
	// out at bind time takes the server down rather than one form.
	Port int
	// Driver is the database engine backing this runtime.
	Driver string
	// Connection holds host, port, username, password, db_name and ssl_enabled as
	// jsonb. Encrypted by the repository before it is written: a database
	// password is every credential in that runtime at once.
	// A string, not storm.JSON, and that is the whole point: what is stored is
	// ciphertext. A database password is worth more than any one connector's
	// token — it is every credential in that runtime at once — so the column
	// holds an encrypted blob, and declaring it jsonb would both fail to parse
	// and, on the day the column types are reconciled, destroy it.
