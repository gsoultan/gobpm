// WorkflowUser is somebody a process can assign work to: an approver, a
// reviewer, whoever the model names.
//
// Scoped to a project, and unique within it. Two projects naming an approver
// "ada" mean two different people, and a directory shared across projects would
// make onboarding one team an act that touches every other team's inbox.
//
// It carries no roles or permissions. What a participant may do is decided by
// the process that names them — a task is offered to an assignee or a candidate
// group, and completing it is the whole of the permission. Access control lives
// on PlatformUser, which is a different population doing a different job.
//
// A task does not reference this row. Assignee and the candidate lists are
// usernames, because a process is authored against people who may have no
// account yet, and refusing to deploy a model until every name in it exists
// would make authoring depend on onboarding. This table is what turns a name
// into somebody who can sign in and act on it.
