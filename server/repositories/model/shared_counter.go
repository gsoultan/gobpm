// Each replica keeps its own row and the limit is the sum, so counting does not
// need a lock and a replica that dies stops contributing rather than holding
// the window open. The four-part key is the identity: a scope, what is being
// counted, who counted it, and which window.
//
// The column is counter_key rather than key, which is reserved on several
// engines.
